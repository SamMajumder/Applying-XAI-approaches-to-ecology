# 🌿 Applying XAI Approaches to Ecology

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains all the code and resources for the project titled "Applying an interpretable machine learning approach to assess intraspecific trait variation under landscape-scale population differentiation". The project focuses on the application of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to assess intraspecific trait variations in ecology.

## 📚 Summary of the Research
The research discusses functional traits in a dataset, emphasizing the missing values for each trait. The study uses visualizations to represent the percentage of missing values for each functional trait and the predictions made by a Random Forest (RF) classifier concerning populations of H. annuus. The data encompasses a wide range of traits reflecting plant architecture, reproductive phenology, tissue chemistry, and morphology of various plant parts. The combined dataset consists of 88 traits from 464 genotypes belonging to 49 populations.
